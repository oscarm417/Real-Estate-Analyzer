# Real-Estate-Analyzer
A script that tries to find undervalued properties

Plan:
Build a Linear regression model that incorporates Zip code, sq feet, room, bathrooms, floors, distance to public transportation, zip code pop density, and real estate funds.
In order to account for the almost yearly increase in real estate prices, I will incorporate real estate etf's into the linear model, so as to account for market exuberance and time. 

Inputs -> Zillow API, Zip Code
Outputs -> Real Estate properties undervalued in a certain zip code. 

*Awaiting Zillow API Key to begin*

========================================================================

Possible Future Plans:
Airbnb Analyzer:
  Analyze Zip Codes for:
    * Average days booked per month
    * Average booking price
    * Average Cleaning Fee
Hopefully this allows me to find the best zip codes to try and set up an airbnb. 
========================================================================
Possible Future Plans2:
Automate the process of messaging houndreds of brokers.
  Many Landlords dont allow airbnbs, however there is a few that will. Hopefully, I can make a contact blast, and based on responses narrow my search down.
